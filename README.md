# Welcome to the Machine

Welcome, my son. This is a tribute to Pink Floydâ€™s _Welcome to the Machine_, as well as a reflection on the evolving relationship between human creativity and machine intelligence. Through a live coding dialogue between human performer and AI, we invite the audience to consider the role of technology not only as a tool but as an active participant in the creative process, raising questions about the future of human-machine collaboration.
